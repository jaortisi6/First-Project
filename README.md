## USER STORY

```
AS A dog owner.

```

## ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

GIVEN an app that allows me to plan a perfect puppy party.
WHEN I open the app,
THEN I see fields to input my location and weather preferences.
WHEN I submit my preferences,
THEN I am presented with days and times where the weather meets my needs and adorable puppy gifs.

## TECHNOLOGIES USED:

```
- Materialize
- jQuery
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
```

## FURTHER DEVELOPMENT

```
Areas for further development include utilizing Google Maps API, to give user nearby dog-friendly parks, and give directions to these parks. Additionally, the user could be alerted when it is time for a scheduled puppy party. This application could also be improved by including an invitation feature, allowing for users to send invites and coordinate with other dog owners for a puppy party.
